# Welcome to Data Analysis with Top-Rated Coffee! ☕️

Let's explore the highest-rated coffees from coffeereviews.com. This is an Exploratory Data Analysis, so enjoy a variety of querying, modeling, and statistical techniques used to find interesting trends and insights about these top-rated coffees. The data table used is from kaggle.com, which can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asimmahmudov/top-rated-coffee.

The jupyter notebook can be found in the file named, "top_rated_coffee.ipynb". The two maps are included separately in their own files, "map_1.html" and "map_2.html".

Sit back, relax, and enjoy a nice cup of coffee as we explore this dataset. I hope you enjoy!
